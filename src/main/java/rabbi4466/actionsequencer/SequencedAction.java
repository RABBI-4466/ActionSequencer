 * Each {@code SequencedAction} is linked to a {@link ActionSequencerSubsystem}, and it defines:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The completion percentage (from 0.0 to 1.0) required to proceed to the next action.</li>
 *   <li>Whether it should wait for all previously running actions to finish before executing.</li>
