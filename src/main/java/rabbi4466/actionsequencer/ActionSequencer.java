/**
 * A state machine that executes a sequence of actions sequentially.
 * <p>
 * Each action is associated with a subsystem and a completion threshold.
 * The sequencer advances to the next action when the current action's subsystem
 * reaches the required completion percentage.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Supports waiting for previous actions to finish before starting the next,
 * and running multiple actions concurrently.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * ActionSequencer fsm = new ActionSequencer()
 *     .addAction(driveSubsystem, driveForwardAction, 0.9)
 *     .addAction(armSubsystem, raiseArmAction, 1.0, true);
 * fsm.start();
 * while(fsm.update()) {
 *   // update robot state, telemetry, etc.
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: The completion percentage is expected to be in the range [0.0, 1.0].
 * </p>
